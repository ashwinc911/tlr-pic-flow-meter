= Build and Develop =

In order to develop, build, and deploy the code for the TLR Flow meter, you will need to correct hardware and software.  The hardware that was utilized for this project was the PIC24/PIC32 PIM Companion Board and was purchased from [http://www.eflightworks.net/]. Eric was the person that I dealt with at eflightworks and was a FANTASTIC resource for supporting his boards.  I purchased a custom configuration for the TLR flow meter and he was always responsive in my *many* support questions as I developed this board. The boards that were purchased were Rev C.

The first thing to note is that the development for this project must be done under windows as that is the only platform that runs the MPLAB IDE that I used to program the PIC board.  So, the first thing to do is install the MPLAB IDE (version 8.10).
